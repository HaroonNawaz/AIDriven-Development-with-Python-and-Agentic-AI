# What is LLM - Spaced Repetition Study Schedule

Optimized schedule for maximum retention using scientifically-proven spaced repetition methodology.

---

## Spaced Repetition Principles

Spaced repetition is most effective memorization method because it:
- Spaces reviews at intervals optimized for long-term retention
- Focuses effort on material you're struggling with
- Removes effort from material you've mastered
- Follows neurobiological principles of how memory works

## Daily Study Routine Recommendation

### 20-30 Minute Daily Session

**Structure**:
1. **Warm-up** (2 minutes): Easy review of mastered cards
2. **Active Recall** (15-20 minutes): Cover answers, test yourself
3. **Learning** (3-5 minutes): Study one new card or review struggling card
4. **Reflection** (1-2 minutes): Mark progress, plan next session

**Time of Day**: Morning typically best (less mental fatigue)

### Weekly Long Session

**Saturday or Sunday** (45-60 minutes):
1. **Full Level Test**: Timed recall test on one level
2. **Weak Areas**: Extra focus on struggling cards
3. **Integration**: Mix cards from multiple levels
4. **Assessment**: Measure progress

## Optimization Tips

### If You're Struggling
- Slow down: Spend extra days on difficult levels
- Re-read comprehensive notes before flashcards
- Create additional mnemonics
- Study related concepts together
- Explain aloud to deepen understanding

### If You're Progressing Fast
- Accelerate review intervals
- Mix difficulty levels earlier
- Create your own flashcards
- Test yourself on related topics
- Move to next topic sooner

### Maintaining Long-term Knowledge
- Use spaced repetition schedule indefinitely
- Periodically increase difficulty (add application questions)
- Apply knowledge in real situations
- Teach others the material
- Create connections to new topics

---

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Forgetting Easy Cards
**Solution**: Review spacing is working as designed. If you forget, it gets reviewed sooner. This is normal and expected.

### Challenge: Advanced Cards Too Difficult
**Solution**: Review basic and intermediate cards first. Advanced cards require solid foundation. Don't rush.

### Challenge: Can't Find Time
**Solution**: 10 minutes daily is better than 60 minutes once weekly. Focus on consistency over duration.

### Challenge: Memorization vs Understanding
**Solution**: Understand first, memorize second. Take time to work through examples until logic is clear.
