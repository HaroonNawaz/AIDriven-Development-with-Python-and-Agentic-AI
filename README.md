# AI-Driven Development with Python and Agentic AI

**Course:** AI-300 | **Institution:** PanaVersity | **Program:** Flagship Program
**Duration:** 3 Months | **Learning Model:** Specifications-First, AI-Native Thinking

---

## 🎯 Course Overview

This repository contains comprehensive coursework and assignments for **AI-300: AI-Driven Development with Python and Agentic AI**, a transformative 3-month program that teaches a paradigm shift in software development.

Rather than writing code line-by-line, you will learn to function as an **orchestrator** who collaborates with AI agents while thinking in specifications. This course bridges the gap between traditional programming and AI-native development practices.

## 📚 Course Philosophy

### From Traditional to AI-Native Development

| Aspect | Traditional | AI-Native |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Approach** | Code-first, test-after | Specification-first, validation-focused |
| **Role** | Developer writes all code | Orchestrator guides AI agents |
| **Workflow** | Manual coding → Testing | Specifications → AI generation → Validation |
| **Quality** | Testing finds bugs | Specifications prevent bugs |
| **Tools** | Text editor + compiler | AI partner + CLI tools + frameworks |

### Key Principles

✅ **Specifications First** - Write clear requirements before code
✅ **AI Collaboration** - Work with AI agents, not against them
✅ **Context Engineering** - Master prompt and context design
✅ **Production Quality** - Build systems ready for real-world use
✅ **Agentic Intelligence** - Design multi-agent autonomous systems

## 💡 Key Concepts Explained

### AI-Native Thinking
The shift from "how do I write this code?" to "what specification should I write so AI can generate correct code?"

### Specifications-First Development
Writing clear, unambiguous specifications before code generation ensures AI produces the exact functionality needed.

### Skill-Based Architecture
Creating reusable, well-documented skills that can be leveraged across projects and shared with others.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
Designing systems where multiple AI agents work together under your direction to solve complex problems.

### Context Engineering
Crafting the right context (prompt, examples, constraints) to guide AI toward desired outputs.

---

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### The AI-Native Workflow

```
1. UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
   ↓
2. WRITE SPECIFICATIONS
   ↓
3. DESIGN WITH CONTEXT
   ↓
4. COLLABORATE WITH AI
   ↓
5. VALIDATE RESULTS
   ↓
6. ITERATE & REFINE
```

This workflow is applied throughout all assignments in this course.
